    <h1>Hello there!</h1>

      <br>

      <p>
        We are MSc students, studying Global Health Policy and are very interested in the mental and physical health.
        We know that many of you are students and could use a little stress relief now and then.
        We certainly do! Here is a list of helpful resources to help you deal with any stress you may be encountering.

        <p>
          Hey palsies. My name is Karolina. I am from Canada.
          My career goals include having a moose ranch, saving the bees, becoming the Minister of Health of all of the world, and having a grove of maple trees.
          In my retirement, I will become a professional hockey player, as is required by my culture.
          My main source of food is maple syrup and Kraft dinner.
          My favourite way to reduce stress is to chase beavers.
          I hope you are able to use these recommendations, eh!
        </p>
